    <b> Description </b> <br>
    A human eye differs from a digital camera a lot. There are some
    biological algorithms our eyes implement to receive a better and
    clearer view of what we see. Digital cameras may not simulate such algorithms
    out-of-the-box (they use some basic digital algorithms, however).
    This software is aimed to simulate some of human eye algorithms such as chromatic
    adaptation and local lightness adaptation to receive a "more natural"
    view of images we get from digital cameras. This project is based on,
    but not equal to implementation of
    <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvcir.2007.06.003'>iCAM06</a> and
    <a href='https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fcol.22131'>CAM16</a> color appearence models.
